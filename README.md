# BARTER UP (BLACK WING HACKATHON PROJECT)
#### Web application engineered to allow folks from lower incomes to swap items or services. 
##### We commonly hear the term "living paycheck to paycheck". Have you ever wondered what happens in the in between? How do folks stretch their income? Some folks barter their services in exchange for goods and services they are in need of. Barter up is able to connect low income folks with other low income folks who are in needs of different goods and services.
